# Intro

In this exercice, we're going to ask you to develop an algorithm which can define a job as **Data Science's job or Not**.

# Exercice 1

## Directions
- Write a algorithm which can define if a job title name is a **data science's job or not**.  
- Test your algorithm on `list_job_to_test.json`
- Write a documentation to explain how work your algorithm.
- If you run out of times, please keep 10 minutes to describe what your next steps might be.
- If you find that there are more aspects of the data that you can realistically investigate to improve you result, please be free to descrive them.

## Inputs 
To help you to develop this algorithm you can find: 
- Job name list define as **Data Scientist's Job** : `list_job_tech_dataScience_YES.json`,
- Tech job name list define as **General tech's Job** but not *Data Scientist's Job* : `list_job_tech_dataScience_NO.json`,

## Output 
When run `$ python3 application.py`, we need to get the result of your algorithm apply to the job list file `list_job_to_test.json`.

## Help 
You can find here two links which can help you to understand easily the Json data format :
